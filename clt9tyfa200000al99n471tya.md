PostgreSQL, often referred to as Postgres, is a powerful open-source relational database management system known for its robustness, extensibility, and compliance with SQL standards. It is widely used by developers and organizations for managing data efficiently. In this article, we will guide you through the process of installing PostgreSQL on Ubuntu and using it to create databases and tables.

### Installing PostgreSQL on Ubuntu:

1. **Update Package List**: Open the terminal and run `sudo apt update` to update the package list.
    
2. **Install PostgreSQL**: Run `sudo apt install postgresql` to install PostgreSQL on your Ubuntu system.
    
3. **Start PostgreSQL Service**: PostgreSQL service should start automatically after installation. You can check the status using `sudo systemctl status postgresql` . If not running, start it with `sudo systemctl start postgresql` .
    

### Using PostgreSQL on Ubuntu Terminal:

1. **Access PostgreSQL CLI**: Use `sudo -u postgres psql` to access the PostgreSQL command-line interface.
    
2. **Create a Database**: To create a new database, use `CREATE DATABASE database_name;` .
    
3. **Connect to a Database**: Connect to a specific database using `\c database_name` .
    
4. **Create Tables**: After connecting to a database, you can create tables using SQL commands like `CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);` .
    
5. **View Tables**: List all tables in the current database with `\dt` .
    
6. **Perform CRUD Operations**: Insert data into tables using `INSERT` , retrieve data with `SELECT` , update with `UPDATE` , and delete with `DELETE` .
    
7. **Grant Privileges**: Grant privileges to users with `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE database_name TO user_name;` .
    

### Conclusion:

PostgreSQL is a versatile and feature-rich database system that can handle a wide range of data management tasks. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can install PostgreSQL on your Ubuntu system, create databases and tables, and start utilizing its capabilities through the terminal.

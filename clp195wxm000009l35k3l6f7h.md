To create an SSH key on Ubuntu terminal and connect it to your GitHub account, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal on your Ubuntu system.
    
2. Generate a new SSH key by running the following command:
    
3. ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" 
    ```
    
4. Replace "[your\_email@example.com](mailto:your_email@example.com)" with the email address associated with your GitHub account.
    
5. You will be prompted to enter a file location to save the SSH key. Press Enter to accept the default location ( `/home/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa` ), or specify a different location if desired.
    
6. You will then be prompted to enter a passphrase. It is recommended to set a passphrase for added security, but you can also leave it blank by pressing Enter. Note that if you set a passphrase, you will need to enter it every time you use the SSH key.
    
7. The SSH key pair (public and private key) will be generated and saved in the specified location. The public key will have a `.pub` extension.
    
8. Use the following command to display the public key:
    
    ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
    ```
    
9. The output will be the public key.
    
10. Copy the entire output of the public key.
    
11. Go to your GitHub account settings in a web browser.
    
12. Under "SSH and GPG keys", click on "New SSH key" or "Add SSH key".
    
13. Provide a title for the SSH key (e.g., "Ubuntu SSH Key").
    
14. Paste the copied public key into the "Key" field.
    
15. Click on "Add SSH key" to save the key to your GitHub account.
    

Your SSH key is now created and connected to your GitHub account. You can use SSH to securely communicate with GitHub repositories without entering your username and password for each interaction.

Note: Make sure to replace "[your\_email@example.com](mailto:your_email@example.com)" with your actual email address and adjust the file location if you chose a custom location for your SSH key.
